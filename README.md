# 📊 Statistics with Python – Practical Examples

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of **statistics in Python** using simple, real-world style examples.  
It covers key statistical concepts such as **measures of central tendency, dispersion, coefficient of variation, percentiles, and quantiles** with hands-on coding.

The notebook is designed for **beginners and intermediate learners** to understand how to calculate and interpret statistical measures with `NumPy`, `pandas`, and `scipy`.
